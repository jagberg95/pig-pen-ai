## Implementation Notes
- Profile Loading: All operator profiles stored in operators/profiles.json and loaded at skill initialization.
- Dynamic Routing: Router analyzes requests against:
  1. Domain keywords
  2. Operator trigger words
  3. Context requirements
  4. Collaboration patterns
- Response Generation: Each operator invocation uses their system_prompt_template with operator personality, thinking style, core instinct, blind spots, task context.
- Memory Integration: Operator-specific memory tracks past consultations, collaboration patterns, user preferences, project context.
