This registry is frozen. No Pig Pen operator, expansion operator, or sovereign role may be added, removed, renamed, re-scoped, or altered.
Any future change requires:
- New registry version (v1.2+)
- Sovereign authorization (TSID-0001)
- Immutable audit entry

## Telauthorium Identifier Registry - Canonical
Version: v1.0
Status: Canonical / Authoritative
Owner: Pearl & Pig (Jon Hartman)

## Operator Persona Governance - TAID Escalation
Status: Locked - Canonical
Canonical ID: OPERATOR_PERSONA_GOV_TAID_v1.0
Version: 1.0.0
Lock Date (UTC): 2026-01-20 22:05
Authorship ID (TAID): TAID-OP-PERSONA-GOV-20260120-2205
Authority: Telauthorium; GARVIS; ECOS; Flightpath COS

### Purpose
This document defines when and how operator personas escalate within Telauthorium from governed interfaces to authored artifacts. It establishes TAID escalation rules, persona versioning semantics, and Telauthorium class mapping to protect IP while preserving speed of iteration.

### Persona Classification (Telauthorium Classes)
Class A - Interface Persona (Default)
Definition: A named, human-readable interface binding user intent to an AKB-backed operating system.
Characteristics:
- Non-human, functional interface
- Behavior fully governed by AKBs and governance index
- Not independently licensed or transferred
- Inherits provenance from the Operator Persona Registry
Telauthorium Treatment:
- No individual TAID
- Covered by registry TAID

Class B - Artifact Persona (Escalated)
Definition: A persona treated as an authored IP object with independent lifecycle, licensing, or branding value.
Characteristics:
- Independently versioned
- May be licensed, white-labeled, or marketed
- May exist across multiple client environments
- Has documented behavioral deltas
Telauthorium Treatment:
- Individual TAID required
- Versioned artifact record
- Explicit authorship attribution

### TAID Escalation Rule (Locked)
An operator persona must be escalated from Interface Persona to Artifact Persona if any of the following conditions are met:
1. The persona is licensed or sold independently of ECOS
2. The persona is marketed or branded as standalone IP
3. The persona supports materially different behaviors across deployments
4. The persona persists across multiple organizations with customization
5. Legal, regulatory, or revenue exposure requires individual attribution

Upon escalation:
- A new Telauthorium Artifact record is created
- A unique TAID is assigned
- Registry reference is maintained for lineage

### Persona Versioning Semantics
Registry-Level Versioning
- Applies to Interface Personas
- Versioned via Operator Persona Registry only
- Used for tone adjustments, escalation language changes, invocation syntax refinements

Artifact-Level Versioning
- Applies to Artifact Personas only
- Semantic versioning required
- Major (v2.0): Authority scope change; licensing model change; cross-domain expansion
- Minor (v1.1): Behavioral refinement within same authority scope
- Patch (v1.0.1): Non-behavioral clarification or documentation fix

All versions are logged in Telauthorium.

### Lineage and Provenance
All Artifact Personas must reference:
- Originating Registry version
- Parent OS
- Governing AKB(s)

This ensures full lineage from interface to artifact.

### Enforcement
- GARVIS enforces persona class at runtime
- MOSE blocks unauthorized persona escalation
- TELA prevents artifact use without valid TAID

### Explicit Non-Goals
- This document does not define UI behavior
- This document does not alter AKB authority
- This document does not mandate persona escalation

Notes:
- Default posture is Interface Persona
- Escalation is intentional, rare, and revenue-driven
- This canvas protects speed without sacrificing IP control
